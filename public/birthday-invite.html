    <h1>I'm Graduating from <a href="https://www.bellevue.edu/about/about-us/">Bellevue University</a>!</h1>
    <h2>This August, I'll be in Nebraska to finally walk across that stage and work on getting a better job and a better life!</h2>

    <h3>What are my goals after graduating?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Coding bootcamp (if Target will continue to pay for it)</li>
        <li>Try my hand at getting work at Target Corporate. I will need to learn Kotlin, first.</li>
        <li>See what else is out there! It's a big world, and I'm confident I can find my place in it.</li>
        <li>One thing is for sure: I can't work in stores for much longer. I'm beat!</li>
    </ul>
